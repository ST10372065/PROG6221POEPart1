### Using the application
Apon starting the application the user is given 6 prompts which they can enter. Only one will work as a recipe needs to be entered before any other methods are able to be used.

After entering a recipe name the user is given prompts to enter how many ingredients, name of ingredient, quantity of the ingredient and finally the unit of measurement of that ingredient.

Once complete user can display the recipe they have just entered. This displays all the information in a neat and readable format.

When scaling the recipe the user has the choice to scale the recipe by half, two or three. Meaning this will either half , double or triple the amount of ingredients that were entered in the begining.

If the recipe has been scaled and the user wants to use the original values again they can simply reset the values.

If the user would like to clear all the saved recipes they can also do so and they will be required to confirm when doing this.
